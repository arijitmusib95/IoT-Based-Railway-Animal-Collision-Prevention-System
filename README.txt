# IoT-Based Railway Animal Collision Prevention System

## 🚂 Overview
An innovative IoT solution designed to prevent collisions between trains and wildlife in jungle areas using ultrasonic sensors, Arduino microcontrollers, and multi-sensory warning systems. This project aims to save wildlife while improving railway safety.

## ⚠️ Problem
Wildlife-train collisions are a significant issue in forested areas, resulting in:
- Animal fatalities
- Train damage and service disruptions
- Environmental impact
- Economic losses

## 🔧 Solution
Our system uses a two-phase approach:

### Phase 1: Train Detection & Animal Warning
Detects approaching trains and activates warning systems to alert animals near the tracks.

**Components:**
- Ultrasonic sensors for train detection
- Arduino Uno microcontroller
- Multi-sensory warning devices:
  - LED flash lights
  - Audio buzzers
  - Vibration units

### Phase 2: Animal Radar System
Monitors for animal presence near tracks and displays their position relative to approaching trains.

**Components:**
- Ultrasonic sensors for animal detection
- Arduino Uno with OLED display
- Radar-style visualization interface
- Distance calculation and mapping algorithms

## 💻 Code Overview

### Train Detection System (`train_detection.ino`)
```arduino
// Simplified excerpt
void loop() {
  // Measure distance with ultrasonic sensor
  distance = duration/58.2;
  // Activate warning devices based on distance thresholds
  if (distance <= 7) {
    digitalWrite(LED1, HIGH);
  }
  else {
    digitalWrite(LED1, LOW);
  }
  // Additional distance checks and LED activations...
}
```

### Animal Radar System (`animal_radar.ino`)
```arduino
// Simplified excerpt
void loop() {
  // Calculate distance
  distance = duration * 0.0344 / 2;
  // Draw radar display
  display.drawCircle(centerX, centerY, radarRadius, SSD1306_WHITE);
  // Map detected objects to radar display
  int objRadius = map(distance, 0, MAX_DISTANCE, 0, radarRadius);
  float x = centerX + objRadius * cos(angle);
  float y = centerY + objRadius * sin(angle);
  display.fillCircle(x, y, 2, SSD1306_WHITE);
  // Update radar sweep
  // ...
}
```
